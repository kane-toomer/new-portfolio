								About me
							</h1>
							<p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
								Hello! My name is Kane Toomer, I'm from Las Vegas and I enjoy
								designing and building things that live on the internet. My
								passion for computer science started back in 2016 during my
								senior year of undergrad. I spent most of my time focusing on
								designing apps and learning to code, often putting more effort
								into it than my Public Administration degree.
								{" (: "}
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
								Post-grad, I attended a coding bootcamp in my hometown, did some
								freelance work and worked on a startup with a friend. I loved
								every second of it (but unfortunately, the world shut down).
								This prompted me to go back to school for computer science. Fast
								forward to today, I am a few weeks away from completing the
								computer science bridge program at Grand Canyon University and
								will be starting the Master of Science in Computer Science
								program in January 2024.
